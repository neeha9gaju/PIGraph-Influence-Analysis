# PIGraph-Influence-Analysis


This project analyzes influence dynamics within GitHub repositories using Plausible Influence Graphs (PIGraphs). We compare Flask Web App and Search Engine communities, computing Plausible Influence Scores based on repository-author and author-author interactions as well as author popularity. The project visualizes influence networks, identifies key contributors, and shows how threshold tuning impacts network connectivity, providing insights into community structure and collaboration.
